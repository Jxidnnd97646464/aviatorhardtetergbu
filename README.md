## The key features of Aviator game to know about

setup** to enjoy.

Aviator from Spribe has been highly successful, thanks to the
possibility of players controlling the outcome of their bets. This makes
it different from online slot machines, where everything occurs
randomly. Instead, playing Aviator Crash allows you to cash in your bet
whenever you can secure a win.

It is important to know that the longer you wait, the more you will
receive in winnings from the game. Of course, this also means there is
more chance for the plane to explode, causing a loss. The control the
game providesÂ **makes it thoroughly inviting and entertaining for me**.

I tend to enjoy the fact that it combines your skill with a little bit
of luck. This ensures that anyone playing always has a thrill. We will
discuss some details about Aviator's design and base theme.



Let's talk about the design of the game Aviator


## A simple design for all to understand

The central focus of this online casino game is the aeroplane, which has
the pilot inside. I found the game quite simple in its design, with only
a few graphic elements standing out, such as the red plane. A sliding
bar is in view above the game's general screen. This highlights the
multiplier that has been reached each round.

At the bottom of the screen, the controls are for setting your wagers.
What stands out about Aviator is that you can set two bets
simultaneously, which run independently.

I like that the chat box is on the left-hand side of the game screen.
This presents the social side of the Aviator game. If you're playing on
a mobile device, this appears below the game screen. You'll also see the
list of all bets placed on that round and the outcome for each player.

The chat box is a great addition, as it allows you to communicate with
other players \*\*and exchange tips on betting successfully on the
game\*\*. Speaking personally, I don't use the chat box that often, \_as
it tends to contain a lot of spam\_ rather than helpful insights into
gambling on Aviator.

## Aspects of Aviator that you need to know before playing

The general idea behind Aviator is that a multiplier grows as the plane
flies across the screen. As the player, you must place your bet before
the plane takes off. As the multiplier increases, you need to determine
when the best point to cash in is, \_and this must occur before the
aeroplane crashes\_.

\*\*It would be best if you remembered the plane crashes completely at
random\*\*. This means that some rounds will see it crash within a few
seconds, and others will see it fly much longer before this happens.
Thus, waiting too long for the chance at a higher multiplier can see you
losing your bet. I know -- I've experienced it!

This enhances the challenging part of the game, \_testing your nerves
and your strategy all at once\_. You need to determine a good point to
bail out of the wager so you can cash in. Do it too early, and you could
miss out on gaining higher winnings. Wait too long, and you'll lose
everything in that round.

My advice? Don't let the fear of missing out (FOMO) take over. Even a
small multiplier cash out is a win!

While luck does play a part in the Aviator casino game, \*\*you do need
the capability to read the game patterns\*\*, too. It is also important
to understand game risk management. Aviator can seem like a simple game
to play, even to newcomers. Yet the most successful players accessing it
frequently use \_specific strategies based on their observations and
experiences while playing\_.



Things to know about the casino game Aviator


## Features of Aviator you need to know about

There are certain things to know about this game before you start
playing it. Awareness of one or two of the game's features can see you
play it at a higher level of preparedness.

### New game begins every 8 to 30 seconds

The rounds in Aviator are speedy. Different games will last between 8
and 30 seconds, \*\*depending on how far the plane flies before it
explodes\*\*. There are about 5 seconds between the plane crashing and
taking off in the next round. \_You can place your bets within that
timeframe\_, so you need to be prepared and act quickly. You can use an
"Auto" function, which manages this part of the game.

### You won't be a winner if the auto cash out is set to 1.01X

There are certain things I learned very quickly from playing Aviator.
After utilising a few tips from around the internet to try and ensure I
won with real money, I discovered that most of them don't work at all.
One of the most pushed strategies for playing the game is to set the
"Auto Cash Out" to 1.01X.

This might seem like a good idea because the plane doesn't usually take
off until it has reached a 1.01X multiplier. Yet, it does happen. Having
tested the strategy of setting this to 1.01X, \_I can confirm that I
would often lose a good portion of my bankroll\_. That being said, the
multiplier does frequently extend beyond the 2.00x multiplier.

### You don't need to own Bitcoin to play Aviator

If you're like me, you'll use a search engine to find online games you
haven't played before. That's why searches like "Aviator crypto" or
"Aviator Bitcoin" are often used for this game. In the early days of the
Aviator game, it was provided solely to online casinos supporting
cryptocurrencies as payment methods.

Now, many online casinos provide the game and support fiat currency
transactions. This means it caters to those people who prefer using
credit cards or e-wallets (like me). It's also the case that these sites
will \*\*offer the Aviator game in demo mode, with Indian rupees as the
main currency\*\*Â to experience it.
